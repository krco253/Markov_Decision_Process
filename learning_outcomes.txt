## Learning Outcomes
- I noticed that this program was yet another instance where the idea of iterating a 
computation until there is a convergence in values was applied in order to 
define decisions. It seems that iterative approaches are particularly useful in AI.
- This program not only taught me an understanding of Markovian transistion models 
for modeling problems in the future, but also a method to actually produce possible
solutions for these models. So, this program equipped me with yet another way to model
problems and a method for solving them. I plan on applying this model and decision process
to a different real world problem in a personal project over Christmas break.
- I initially had utility values stored in an array of integers instead of double floats.
What a difference it made!

## Reflection on CS 463
It's been quite the semester in this class; CS 463 is definitely the most challenging
course I've taken so far. One of my favorite things about the class was the opportunity
that the midterm and final projects for the class presented to delve into what kind of
questions the field of Artificial Intelligence is diving into now, in the present. 
This course frustrated and challenged me, but, at the end of the day, it is because of
those frustrations and challenges that I thoroughly enjoyed this course and wish that 
I could take a whole semester solely devoted to this course. Thanks for the learning
experience!
